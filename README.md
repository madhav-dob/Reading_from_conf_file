# Reading_from_conf_file   

## In this repo you can make changes in the config file only instead of changing in the whole Project code!!    

# You need to create two files
1.) Main.c   
2.) Conf.txt   

# Conf.txt   

in this file you specify all the parameters in a key-value storing that you may need to change very often!!      

# Main.c   

This is your main file where you first define the structure of all the parameters you defined in the config file    

Then you create a function which reads the conf files and reads all the parameters    

Finally, you print those values to see if it's working!!   



# Copy paste the whole code from the files Given    

Compile the C file witht the command and make an executable fiel   



              gcc Main.c -o test           

Now run the executable file using this   



               ./test     


               



# NOTE_HERE!!!    

 This is just an example file for the testing, you need to do this in your project then customize the files accordingly !!
